# this chapter is all about funnction 
# what is function ?
#A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. 
# You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. 
# A function can return data as a result.

# pprint is a function it call the following string as output.
# print("01_we are learning python with ammar .")
# print("02_we are learning python with ammar .")
# print("03_we are learning python with ammar .")
# print("04_we are learning python with ammar .")
# print("05_we are learning python with ammar .")
# print("06_we are learning python with ammar .")
# print("07_we are learning python with ammar .")
