print(30/10) # after divides we will get a float number 
# why it is give us float number?
# because float is  a data structure .
print(30//10) # if you want to get an answer in INT so use double //
print(17%2) # it will give the remender after division

print(2**3) # it mean that 2 ki power 3 = 8 

# PEMDAS (parenthisis exponent multiplication division addition and subtraction)
# basically python use this pemdas rules.
