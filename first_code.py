# this is our second day of python with data scienc
# and i want to store some vocablary here that i leran in this course 
# differnt time zone = mean that log mukhtalif ghajo per betain hain.
# so unka time alag alag hain
# grab karay = pakhray
# pause us and go for it = sath sath code ko run karna


print("hello world ")

print("so lets start with dedication and patience")


# shorcut for comment is control+/
# commnt out mean a sentence is commented


# varriables
# it make easy our work 
# in python we use varriables to store data example
x = 3+5+8*6
print(x)
# now add something with the above data 
3+5+8*+10
# we can simply write the exprssion as 
x+10 #this is advantage of varriable in programing
